# 🐾 Pawfect Match — Responsive Pet Adoption Page
This project was built as part of Task 4 – Make a Website Mobile-Friendly Using CSS Media Queries in my Web Development Internship.

The mission: Take a desktop-only pet adoption page and make it purr-fectly responsive 🐱🐶 using CSS media queries and mobile-first design — with a sprinkle of Tailwind magic.

## 📖 The Task
From the internship brief:

Objective: Convert an existing desktop-only page to a mobile-friendly layout using media queries.
Key Concepts: Media Queries, Responsive Web Design, Viewport, CSS Units (%, rem, vw).

So that’s exactly what I did:

Resized layouts for sm, md, lg breakpoints 📱💻

Added a hamburger menu 🍔 for small screens

Ensured images scale without breaking the layout

Fixed overflow & scrolling issues 🛠

Made the pet grid adapt from 3 columns → 2 columns → 1 column depending on screen size

## ✨ Features
📱 Fully Responsive Layout – Works from 320px to 1440px+

🍔 Hamburger Menu on Mobile – Clean navigation for small screens

🐶 Pet Cards with Hover Zoom – Images stay neatly clipped inside the card

🖼 Image Scaling – No more overflow

💬 Placeholder Sections – Home, Pets, Contact (not functional, just for layout demo)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
HTML5 – Structure

Tailwind CSS – Utility-first responsive styling

CSS Media Queries – Core task requirement

JavaScript – To toggle the mobile hamburger menu

## 🚀 How to View
Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pawfect-match.git

Open the folder:

cd pawfect-match
Open index.html in your browser

Resize your window to see the responsiveness in action

📄 Note for Reviewers
This project fulfills Task 4 of the internship: converting a fixed desktop design into a mobile-friendly, responsive layout.
The focus is on media queries, flexible grids, and responsive images — not on backend functionality.
